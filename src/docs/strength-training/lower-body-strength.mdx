Strong legs and good footwork form the foundation of table tennis. Paddlers have to stay squatted for most parts of the match, which puts a lot of stress on the glute muscles and hamstrings. They have to make sure to not lose that intensity in that position for the duration of the match, which could stretch for up to an hour. Table tennis might be a game played with hands, but legs are clearly the powerhouse.

## Lunges

Static lunges are great for working all of the major muscles of the hips, glutes, and thighs.

## Step Ups

A step-up is a simple body resistance exercise that works muscles in the legs and buttocks. A step-up targets the quadriceps, and hamstrings, as well as the gluteal muscles in the buttocks. This offers a good cardio and strength workout.

## Sumo Squats

The sumo squat is a great lower-body strength exercise that emphasizes the muscles of the inner thigh and glutes. Based on your core strength, you might find the sumo squat adds an additional challenge to your balance because your body is in a different alignment and needs extra stability to keep from moving forward and back on the heels.
Once you've mastered the bodyweight version, you can load it up.

## Deadlifts

Deadlift is a compound exercise that utilizes several muscle groups. This move also relies on core strength to stabilize your body throughout the lift. Deadlift training produces a lot of muscle activation in your lower body, all the muscles of the legs, back, core, and hips.

## Globlet Squats

Goblet Squats are a fundamental lower body exercise, and goblet squats are a great variation for beginners and expert athletes alike.
 
In addition to working the glutes and quadriceps, goblet squats involve muscles in the core and arms, making it a well-rounded exercise for tennis players.


## Burpees

Burpees have a reputation for a reason. They're one of the most effective-and crazy-challenging-exercises out there. 
The burpee is a true full-body exercise, working most major muscle groups while also improving your cardiovascular fitness, and testing your balance and co-ordination.

## Calf Raises

Calf raises are an easy, low-impact method for strengthening the calves. Strong calf muscles result in better stability and balance, decreased risk of ankle and knee injuries, and better agility when running and jumping. Once strengthened, it allows more rapid, explosive movement, making this a great exercise for table tennis players.

## Clamshell

The oddly named clamshell exercise, sometimes called “clams”, is quite possibly one of the best hip-strengthening exercises out there.
Not only is it incredible for strengthening the hips, glutes, and pelvis, but the clamshell can also help to prevent injury and ease lower back tension.
